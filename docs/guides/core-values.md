# Core Values

The **«Cowry»** system attempts to facilitate collaborative writing between both the GM and the players. While the GM still has the final say over many of the mechanics present in their events, the players have their own opportunities to contribute ideas. A key component is that GMs shouldn't be trying to tell a strict story (railroading), but moreso have an initial idea and improvise based on their players' actions.

Discussion is paramount in this system; both between the players themselves, and between the GM and the players. There could be many potential paths, but none of them are necessarily the **only** correct path. It is up to the players to decide what they want to do, and for the GM to shape the narrative accordingly.
