# First Steps

No doubt you are here in an attempt to learn how to mod FFXIV. These guides are more specifically for mod authoring, so if you have little idea how to mod your own FFXIV with other mods, you should do that first. A good place to start is Serenity's excellent [Intro to Penumbra](https://reniguide.info/) guide.

Once you've got a handle on actually using mods in <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd>, you're ready to begin creating your own mods!
