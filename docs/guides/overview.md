# System Overview

Laht'dlan Logistics uses an adapted tabletop system for roleplaying in FFXIV based on [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/). These pages serve as a documentation for the system in order to prime new players for roleplaying. Henceforth, this adapted system will simply be called the **«Cowry»** system to distuinguish it from Blades in the Dark.

If you're already familiar with the Blades in the Dark system, feel free to look over the sections to see what has changed.
