# Rolling the Dice

The «Cowry» system uses six-sided dice for everything that requires rolls. Generally, several will be rolled at once and the highest will be used. There are three standard outcomes from rolls:

* The highest die is a **six** -- you get a **full success**, accomplishing what you set out to achieve with no negative consequences. If you got multiple sixes, you get an additional effect.
* The highest die is a **four or five** -- you get a **partial success**, accomplishing what you set out to achieve, but with some consequences.
* The highest die is **three or lower** -- you **failed** to accomplish anything, suffering consequence(s) instead.
