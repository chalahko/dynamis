# Quick Reference for Players

## During GM Phase

As a player, the GM phase is when your character will be **reacting** to threats presented by the GM. It's possible you won't have any actions to do during this phase. If your character is indeed threatened by something, the GM will make a **threat roll** for the danger, and you will have to react to it.

### Phase Breakdown

- GM chooses players being threatened, either by random or by choice
- GM rolls a singular threat roll for each **different** threat
- Players who are threatened must choose a stance in response to the roll
- Players then write out their response (or optionally combine it with their action)

::: tip  INTERVENTIONS
In the case that another player wishes to defend yours, they can as long as they also aren't threatened. Any interventions require a **Braced** stance.

## During Player Phase

The player phase is when you, as a player, can perform **proactive** actions of your own. Whether that be healing, attacking, or bolstering your allies is up to you. Remember, if you chose a stance during the GM phase, you must use the same stance for this phase.

Something different about this phase compared to other systems is that you're writing your own actions and the enemy's response. The GM's role during this phase is to simply inform players when their actions require a threat roll. When controlling the enemy, try to represent their power according to the roll. Don't undersell a high roll and don't oversell a low one.

### Phase Breakdown

- Players declare their intended action
- GM decides which players must make a threat roll for their action
- Players roll their own threat rolls and determine their stance (if not already)
- Players then write out their own action **and** the enemy's response

## Stances

Stances are the key to retaining player agency in this system, allowing you to choose how your character reacts to threats. There are a total of four stances, and one is chosen when threats are presented to the player. In cases where players aren't threatened, the default stance is **Offensive**.
