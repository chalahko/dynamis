It&#39;s possible you won&#39;t have any actions to do during this phase. If your character is indeed threatened by something, the GM will make a <strong>threat roll</strong> for the danger, and you will have to react to it.</p><h3 id="phase-breakdown" tabindex="-1">Phase Breakdown <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-breakdown" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>GM chooses players being threatened, either by random or by choice</li><li>GM rolls a singular threat roll for each <strong>different</strong> threat</li><li>Players who are threatened must choose a stance in response to the roll</li><li>Players then write out their response (or optionally combine it with their action)</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INTERVENTIONS</p><p>In the case that another player wishes to defend yours, they can as long as they also aren&#39;t threatened.

Whether that be healing, attacking, or bolstering your allies is up to you. Remember, if you chose a stance during the GM phase, you must use the same stance for this phase.</p><p>Something different about this phase compared to other systems is that you&#39;re writing your own actions and the enemy&#39;s response. The GM&#39;s role during this phase is to simply inform players when their actions require a threat roll. When controlling the enemy, try to represent their power according to the roll. Don&#39;t undersell a high roll and don&#39;t oversell a low one.</p><h3 id="phase-breakdown-1" tabindex="-1">Phase Breakdown <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-breakdown-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>Players declare their intended action</li><li>GM decides which players must make a threat roll for their action</li><li>Players roll their own threat rolls and determine their stance (if not already)</li><li>Players then write out their own action <strong>and</strong> the enemy&#39;s response</li></ul><h2 id="stances" tabindex="-1">Stances <a class="header-anchor" href="#stances" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Stances are the key to retaining player agency in this system, allowing you to choose how your character reacts to threats.
